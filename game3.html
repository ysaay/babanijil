<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Death By</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">Pick a category of things (animals, colors, breakfast cereals, etc), then go around the room and have everyone add to the list of things alphabetically (e.g. alligator, baboon, camel...).<br>
	If the kid says "uhh," "umm," or otherwise hesitates before blurting out his answer, that kid has to silently act out a "death by" of your choosing.<br>
	Sounds a little morbid, but it should be something silly (like "death by homework" or "death by goldfish"), never anything like death by a weapon.<br>
	The resulting play is generally pretty hilarious (depending on how much the kid gets into it).<br><br><br>
	
	The game is meant to be quick-paced, and you can definitely get through a round in 5 minutes.</p>
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 4 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page4" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Wink Murder</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">Choose one student to be the detective and send them out of the room, then choose a murderer.<br>
	When the detective comes back and rejoins the class (sitting in a circle), the murderer starts sneakily winking at random students, who then "die" dramatically.<br>
	The detective has to figure out who is doing the winking.<br>
	A less morbid one is a rhythm-based one -- same idea with a detective but instead of a murderer, everyone plays a simple beat (knees-clap, knees-clap) and the chosen student surreptitiously changes the beat or the action (eg change to fingersnap-clap-knees).<br>
	Everyone has to follow their lead and the detective has to work out who is changing the beat.</p>	
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 5 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page5" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Drawing Game</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">If you have a whiteboard, you can use 3 markers, if not use a chalkboard and 3 pieces of chalk.<br>
	On the board you write the numbers 1, 2, and 3 near the top.<br>
	Basically as high as an average child in the classroom can reach while straining.<br>
	Don't write it at normal writing height.<br><br><br>
	Space the numbers about 2-3 feet apart.<br>
	Enough room so 1 kid can stand under a number and have elbow room.<br>
	You also set up a chair at the opposite end of the room from the boards. <br>
	Pick a student and sit them in the chair. <br>
	Turn the chair so the person sitting in the chair looks away from the board.<br>
	You don't want them to see the ones who you will pick now. <br>
	Pick 3 kids now. Being silent as to not give away who the child is. <br>
	(You'll see why) The first kid picked goes to 1, second to 2, third to 3. <br>
	If you need to point and remind, go ahead. <br>
	If you use 3 different colored markers, you can write the numbers using a different color.<br>
	That way,it is obvious who goes where. <br>
	Okay. So now you have 3 kids up at the board and 1 at the back. <br>
	You instruct the ones at the board to "Draw a ____." <br>
	Fill in the blank with your choice! Cat, dog, tree, mouse, etc. Something fast and simple.<br>
	Give them 30 seconds to draw. When they are finished, they sit down quietly.<br>
	The person at the back turns around and picks their "favorite." <br>
	It will not always be the best! Whoever has drawn that picture is the new "judge." <br>
	From the other two, choose 1 to erase the board (leaving the numbers) and choose the other to pick the 3 next players, waiting of course until the "judge" turns the other way.<br>
	And you pick something else to draw, and continue on as long as you like!<br><br><br>
	
	*Note: You can use the ticket system that is described for Heads Up 7-Up below.<br>
	Since 3 kids are "used up" each each time, you can quickly go through the whole class.</p>
	
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 6 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page6" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Heads Up 7-Up!</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">You know the game. <br>
	Pick 7 students. 1 is the leader. They come to the front.<br>
	The leader says, "Heads down, thumbs up."<br>
	The 7 go around and touch 1 thumb each. <br>
	Then when all are back to the front, leader calls, "heads up, 7 up." <br>
	The 7 chosen students stand and one by one are asked to guess who picked them. <br>
	If they are right, they switch places with 1 being part of the picking students. <br>
	If they guess wrong, they sit down. <br>
	After all guess, students reveal who picked who. <br>
	And it starts again.<br><br><br>
	*Ticket system: Cut out colored pieces of construction paper, about the size of a raffle ticket. <br>
	Pass 1 to all students who are not part of the first 7 chosen. <br>
	Instead of touching a thumb, the 7 students take a ticket. <br>
	Collect them in a pile or can each round. <br>
	So, for each round, instruct the group of 7 that they need to pick ones with tickets. <br>
	They don't need to pick all tickets all the time. <br>
	Just some tickets all the time.<br>
	When all tickets are used, each student has had a chance.<br>
	Pass out the tickets again, and do the same thing. <br>
	That way, all students get picked, multiple times, no matter what!<br>
	You can even do 1 extra round after all tickets are gone to give students a free choice if you wish.</p>
	
</div>
  
<!-- Start of Page 7 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page7" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Who is missing?</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">You pick one student to be "it." <br>
	They sit in a chair and face away from the class, closing their eyes. <br>
	You need a closet or cabinet or wall that a student can "hide" behind and not be seen by the person in the chair.<br>
	You quietly point to a student to "hide." While they are hiding, you count to 10. <br>
	The rest of the students change desks. At 10, all must sit down.<br>
	You can speed up the count if you need to maintain the chaos.<br>
	You then ask the person who is "it" to turn around and guess who is missing. <br>
	It is actually harder than it seems. Sometimes I found myself forgetting who was hidden. <br>
	What makes it hard is that all students are mixed up now. If they guess right, they get to stay.<br>
	The person who was hidden picks the next hider. If they guess wrong, they pick the next student to hide then sit down.<br>
	You can make a max number of right guesses allowed so a good guesser does not hog it all. I like 3. <br>
	If they guess 2 in a row, they get to play just one more no matter what. That way, you use up a lot of students and keeps it moving. <br>
	Again, you can use a modified ticket system to keep track of who has been chosen.</p>
	
</div>

  <!-- Start of Page 8 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page8" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Four corners</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">Put the numbers 1 to 4, fairly large on pieces of paper. <br>
	That is, one number per paper.<br>
	Tape one paper in each corner of the classroom.<br>
	Sometimes a cupboard will block the corner, so tape it accordingly.<br>
	You then have 4 corners, each numbered from 1 to 4. <br>
	Cut a paper into 4 equal pieces. Put the numbers 1 to 4, one on each piece.<br>
	Fold them up and put these 4 papers in a box, bag, can, or similar.<br>
	Now, you tell all students in the class to go to a corner. <br>
	You pick a number from the bag and read it.<br>
	All students in that corner must sit down. You tell the class to switch corners. <br>
	The rule is they cannot stay at the same corner. <br>
	You count to 10 (or less) and pick another number. <br>
	Remember to put chosen numbers back in the container. <br>
	Again, all students at that corner sit down. <br>
	You keep repeating this until you have 4 or less. <br>
	When there are 4 or less, on each draw they must switch their corners and they cannot be at the same corner as someone else.<br>
	Sometimes at the end, you will need to draw a few times as some corners will be empty. <br>
	Eventually, you will call the last corner with a student in it and the other student will be the only one left--the winner! <br>
	You can then play again, with the winner picking numbers.<br>
</p>
	
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 9 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page9" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Silent ball</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">Used to be my favorite. <br>
	You need a nerf ball or very soft ball.<br>
	Students sit on desks and toss the ball around. <br>
	If they talk, they are "out" and must sit down. <br>
	If they drop the ball, throw it so it is uncatchable, or interfere with a throw or a catch, they are out and must sit down. <br>
	If they drop a cathcable ball, they are also out. <br>
	Soon, all but 1 student is left as the winner. <br>
	You can modify this if you wish. <br>
	One problem is students sitting down get bored.<br>
	Bored student=loud student. <br>
	You can have it so nobody gets out, just needs to be quiet.<br>
	Tossing a ball around in the classroom is its own reward!<br><br><br>
	You need more rules, however to make it safe: -If you drop the ball, then you ARE THE ONLY student to go and get the ball. <br>
	-No standing, waving hands, calling out, or other unsafe practices. <br>
	-You need to keep a handle on this game as it can do some harm to the classroom.</p>
	
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 11 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page11" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">"I love you honey"</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">One student sits up the front. <br>
	One at a time students come up and say to them, "I love you honey, won't you please smile?" and the main person replies, "I love you honey, but I just can't smile." <br>
	The idea is to put on your silliest voice or make your craziest face to make that person smile <br>
	-- if they do, the asker becomes the main person.</p>
	
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 12 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page12" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Fruit salad</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">Everyone sits in a circle in chairs and is allocated a fruit name. <br>
	There should be two of each fruit, roughly opposite each other. <br>
	One person stands in the middle and calls out fruit names, one by one. <br>
	If you're an apple, and the person in the middle calls 'apples!', you have to get up and switch chairs with the other apple before the person in the middle takes their chair. <br>
	Whoever's left standing becomes the new person in the middle.<br>
	And at some point, the person in the middle can call 'fruit salad!' and mad seat-grabbing ensues.</p>
	
</div>

<!-- Start of Page 13 -->
<div data-role="page" data-theme="b" id="page13" >
<p><a href="#pageTwo" data-role="button">Splat!</a></p>
	<p align="center" class="slide">Kids ranging in age from 4-14.<br>

1. All the kids stand in a circle. One kid goes in the middle: he is the Splatter. <br>
The Splatter is always right; nobody can argue with the Splatter.<br><br>

2.The Splatter throws an imaginary pie at any kid in the circle and says "splat!"<br>
This gesture should sort of look like a high-five.<br>
The Splatter can be slightly tricky about this (turning suddenly so it's unexpected, etc).<br><br>

3.The kid who had the pie thrown at her immediately ducks (so the pie doesn't hit her). She doesn't say anything.<br>
The two kids on either side of that kid must immediately turn towards each other and throw imaginary pies at each other (over the head of the kid who ducked). <br>
They must both say "splat!" <br>
These two reactions (the ducking and the side-splatters' splatting) must be as fast and simultaneous as possible.<br><br>

4.If one of the reactors was slow or made a mistake, then the splatter points at that kid and nicely says "sorry, you're out!" <br>
You can make up funny nicknames for the mistakes to make the kids laugh.<br>
 For instance if the wrong kid splats, that's a mistake and you can gently tease them and call them a "happy splatter". <br>
 If a side-splatter forgets to say splat, they're a "silent splatter". or the ducker doesn't duck, they're a "sleepy splattee", or the ducker says splat, "splatty ducker!" <br>
 Make it funny so they all giggle.<br>
No arguing with the splatter, the splatter is always right.<br>
Not every turn must end with someone going out- if all three reactors are perfect, they can all stay in.<br><br>

5. If you're out, you leave the circle and watch from behind.<br>
Do not rearrange the circle- leave awkward gaps in it. <br>
This makes it harder because suddenly the side-splatter might not be directly beside the kid who ducks. <br>
But the side-splatter must still be the kid "beside" the ducker. <br>
As more people leave the circle, this might mean the side-splatters are very far away from the ducker, although still technically "beside" them. <br>
It's tricky!<br><br>

5.5 Continue splatting til only two kids are left.<br>
Now those two kids must stand back to back.<br>
Ask all the kids to choose a secret word. Say it's "kangaroo".<br>
The Splatter begins to tell a made-up story. <br>
As the story continues, the last two kids slowly walk away from each other, facing back to back.<br>
They're listening for the secret word.<br>
The Splatter can be tricky and put in words that sound like the secret word... <br>
"Once upon a time Johnny went to the zoo and he saw a KKK....koala! And a KKK...cat! And a KKK...Kangaroo!"<br><br>

6.When the Splatter finally says the secret word, the two last kids must immediately spin back to each other and Splat each other! <br>
Whoever is faster wins the game!</p>
